# is the observed potential contact with other cod PC(t).  Third and fourth columns 
# are the 90# limit values of PC(t) from a random arrangement PC(t)0.05 and
# PC(t)0.95.  Fifth column is the average potential contact from a random
# arrangement PC(t)ran. Sixth column is the significance (p) value.  This is the
# number of randomisations in which potential contact was higher than that observed.
# Seventh column is the extra contact with other cod XC(t).  Eighth and ninth columns 
# are the 5# and 95# confidence intervals of XC(t).
